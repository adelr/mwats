## The latest data pipeline is in the SQL folder

Adel's TODO

- [x] visualise data using holoviews
- [x] write data to either feather or parquet format (the latter doesn't preserve datetime objects)
- [x] vectorise data manipulation using pandas
- [x] extract state space models output coefficients from statsmodels object
- [x] visualise source stats results using nonlinear embedding and hierachical clustering (proof of concept)
- [x] perform fast nearest neighbour computation using nmslib
- [x] pull source candidate (esp. pulsar) info from online database
